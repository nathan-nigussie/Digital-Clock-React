# Digital Clock

- A React-built digital clock. It has a simple and sleek interface that displays the current time in real time. Users can easily see the hours, minutes, and seconds update as the clock ticks.
- I utilized React's state management to keep track of the current time and update the clock accordingly.
- Principles of React useState and useEffect Hooks are used.
